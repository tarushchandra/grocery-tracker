Build a Modern Grocery Credit Tracker Mobile App (Offline-First)

Create a mobile-first grocery credit tracker application with a modern, premium UI/UX. The app is designed for a real-world use case where a user deposits a lump sum amount (e.g., ₹500) with a local shopkeeper and makes daily purchases that get deducted from that stored balance.

The app must work offline-first and store all data locally on the device.

Deposits money with a shopkeeper.

Purchases groceries daily.

Track today's purchases

See remaining balance stored with shopkeeper

View monthly breakdown of expenses

Visualize spending trends

Quickly add commonly purchased items

Platform & Tech Requirements

Platform: Mobile App (React Native / Expo preferred)

Local Storage: SQLite or secure persistent local storage (no backend)

State Management: Modern approach (Zustand or Redux Toolkit)
